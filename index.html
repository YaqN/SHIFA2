<p>On your special day, it's not just another day but a moment to celebrate <strong>YOU</strong>—a brilliant economy student with a mind as sharp as yours.</p>
<p><strong>Shifa</strong>, your name means "healing," and it couldn’t be more fitting because you have a way of bringing warmth, comfort, and joy to everyone around you.

<p>So, today is special because it's the day we celebrate you! Happy 20th Birthday, Shifa! 🎈</p>
